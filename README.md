# istat-menus-settings-export-import

These are my custom settings for the IStat Menus program, the settings of the top bar of the icons and their colors, as well as the settings for custom control of the MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) fan about.

In order to use them, download the file, run the IStat Menus program, select the file in the top menu and click import, then specify the downloaded file with the settings.
